Your outline is spot-on and follows the standard "authorization-code" OAuth pattern. Here's a slightly more formal breakdown—with a few notes and best-practices sprinkled in—to make sure every piece slots into your existing React + Node/Express + PostgreSQL stack cleanly:

---

## 1. User Authentication (Google → JWT)

1. **Trigger**: User hits `/login` (your `@login.jsx` UI).
2. **Google OAuth flow**: Redirect → Google → callback → you verify, then
3. **Issue JWT**: You mint a JWT (with a short TTL, stored in an HttpOnly Secure cookie or localStorage + in-memory refresh) and send it to the client.
4. **Client state**: Client now includes that JWT in `Authorization: Bearer …` for all subsequent `/api/*` calls.

> **Tip:** Store the JWT in an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookie to minimize XSS risk.

---

## 2. Raindrop "Connect" (React UI → Backend → Raindrop)

1. **UI**: User visits `raindrop.jsx` and clicks **Connect Raindrop**.
2. **Full-page navigation**

   ```jsx
   <Button
     component="a"
     href={`${API_BASE}/api/raindrop/oauth/start`}
   >
     Connect Raindrop
   </Button>
   ```

   * This GET hits your Express route without any CORS gymnastics.
3. **Server** (`GET /api/raindrop/oauth/start`)

   * Read `req.user` from your JWT middleware.
   * Generate a **`state`** payload (e.g. a signed JWT or random nonce that you also cache in Redis/DB keyed by user\_id), embed user\_id + expiry.
   * Redirect (302) to

     ```
     https://raindrop.io/oauth/authorize?
       client_id=…&
       redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fangushally.com%2Fapi%2Fraindrop%2Foauth%2Fcallback&
       response_type=code&
       state=<signed-state>
     ```
   * **No JSON** here—just a straight redirect so the browser handles it.

> **Best Practice:** Persist the `state` server-side (or use a signed JWT with a jti lookup) so you can later verify it exactly matches.

---

## 3. Callback & Token Exchange (Raindrop → Your Backend)

1. **Raindrop** sends user back to

   ```
   GET /api/raindrop/oauth/callback?code=<code>&state=<state>
   ```
2. **Server** (`/oauth/callback`)

   * Verify the incoming `state` matches your stored record (and isn't expired).
   * POST to Raindrop's token endpoint with `code`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uri`.
   * Receive `{ access_token, refresh_token, expires_in, … }`.
   * **Persist** these tokens in your `raindropTokens` table, linking them to `user_id`.
   * Redirect the user back to your React page—e.g.

     ```js
     res.redirect('/projects/bookmarks/raindrop');
     ```

> **Tip:** Store token expiry (`Date.now() + expires_in * 1000`) so you know when to auto-refresh.

---

## 4. Fetching & Syncing Bookmarks

1. **Initial load of `raindrop.jsx`**

   * On mount, client calls `GET /api/raindrop/bookmarks`.

2. **Server** (`/bookmarks`)

   * Look up the user's Raindrop tokens.
   * If `expires_at < now`, do a **refresh**:

     ```js
     POST https://raindrop.io/oauth/access_token
     { 
       grant_type: 'refresh_token', 
       refresh_token, 
       client_id, 
       client_secret 
     }
     ```
   * If refresh fails (refresh token revoked/expired), throw a 401 so React can show "Connect Raindrop" again.
   * Otherwise, call Raindrop's API with `access_token` → fetch bookmarks → return them as JSON.

3. **UI**

   * Display bookmarks in `raindrop.jsx`.
   * Optionally show a **Sync** button to re-fetch on demand.

> **UX Note:** If the user "Connects" successfully but you detect no tokens, show "Sync Bookmarks" (i.e. "You're connected—click to load").

---

## 5. Error & Edge-Case Handling

* **State mismatch / replay** → 400 "Invalid state, please retry."
* **Token refresh failure** → 401 "Connection expired—please reconnect."
* **API rate-limits or network errors** → 502 or 503 with friendly retry UI.
* **Revoked scopes** → treat like refresh failure.

---

### Final Checklist

* [x] JWT issued & sent securely.
* [x] `/oauth/start` is a redirect, not a CORS-raftered fetch.
* [x] `state` is cryptographically protected and tied to `user_id`.
* [x] Exchange `code` immediately on the server.
* [x] Persist `access_token` & `refresh_token` with expiries.
* [x] Auto-refresh tokens when needed, with fallback UX.
* [x] Sync endpoint for bookmarks with proper error codes.

That should align perfectly with your existing architecture—and avoid any CORS headaches in production. Let me know if you'd like samples for the state-management code or anything more detailed!

## 6. Raindrop API Endpoints Reference

### OAuth Endpoints (Base: `https://raindrop.io`)
- **Authorization**: `https://raindrop.io/oauth/authorize`
- **Token Exchange**: `https://raindrop.io/oauth/access_token`

### API Endpoints (Base: `https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1`)
- **Get Collections**: `https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/collections`
- **Get Raindrops**: `https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/raindrops/{collectionId}`
  - Use `collectionId=0` to get all unsorted bookmarks
  - Use specific collection ID to get bookmarks from that collection

### Important Notes:
- OAuth endpoints use `raindrop.io` domain (NOT `api.raindrop.io`)
- API endpoints use `api.raindrop.io/rest/v1` domain
- Never mix these domains - OAuth will fail if you use the API domain for authorization
