            <p>Hi, I'm Angus Hally. I'm a strategy manager and 
                amateur developer. I've worked in the technology 
                industry for over a decade, and I'm passionate 
                about the intersection of technology, business, 
                and society. I'm currently working on a number 
                of projects, including a blog and a portfolio 
                of my work. I'm excited to share my thoughts and 
                work with you. Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
