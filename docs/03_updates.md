  - App is now successfully running on Heroku (release v136)
- **Environment Variable Loading**: Fixed issues with environment configuration
  - Updated `config/env.js` to properly handle `DATABASE_URL` parsing
  - Made database migration script idempotent to handle existing tables
  - Added proper `start` script for Heroku deployment

### Mantine Layout Standardization - 2025-05-20
- Standardized layout hierarchy across all JSX files following Mantine best practices:
  - Root level: `Box > Container` for page structure
  - Component level: `Container > Box` for:

### Development Workflow Improvement - 2025-05-19

### Frontend API Base URL & Environment Sync Fix â€“ 2025-05-19
#### API Endpoint Resolution
- Added defensive fallback in `react-ui/src/utils/apiClient.js` to use `'/api'` when `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` is missing or invalid
- Ensures frontend always targets same-origin backend, relying on CRA proxy in development
- Resolved `http://localhost:undefined/...` fetch error caused by stray shell variables

#### Environment Configuration
- Enhanced `scripts/sync-env.js` documentation/comments to clarify automatic generation of React `.env.*` files

### Raindrop Connection UI Fix - 2025-01-27
- Fixed issue where "Connect Raindrop" button wasn't appearing:
  - Problem: Test tokens in database caused verify endpoint to return `isConnected: true`
  - Solution: Created `scripts/clear-raindrop-tokens.js` utility to remove test tokens
  - The UI correctly shows "Connect Raindrop" when no valid tokens exist
  - The verify endpoint checks for token existence, not validity (by design)
- Note: If you see "Sync Bookmarks" instead of "Connect Raindrop", run:
  ```bash
  node scripts/clear-raindrop-tokens.js <user-id>
  ```
- Created database migration for raindrop schema:
  - Added `raindrop.bookmarks` table for storing synced bookmarks
  - Added `raindrop.collections` table for future collection support
  - Migration handles existing `raindrop.tokens` table gracefully
- Updated documentation:
  - Added raindrop schema to `docs/04_schema.md`
  - Updated database documentation in `docs/05_database.md`
- Organized test files according to project structure:
  - Moved `insert_test_tokens.js` and `test_raindrop_sync.js` to `server/tests/`
- Created `scripts/check-raindrop-bookmarks.js` utility for debugging bookmark sync issues
- **Next steps for user**: Click "Sync Bookmarks" button in the UI to fetch bookmarks from Raindrop

## 2025-01-27

### Feature Work
- **Raindrop.io Integration** - Successfully implemented and debugged bookmark syncing functionality
  - Fixed API endpoint issue - was using incorrect endpoint for fetching bookmarks
  - Changed from iterating through collections to using collection ID 0 (all bookmarks)
  - Fixed database query result handling in `saveBookmarks.js`
  - Added comprehensive error logging and debugging
  - Successfully synced 3 bookmarks from user's Raindrop account
  - Frontend now properly displays synced bookmarks with title, link, and tags

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `saveBookmarks` function to use `result.rows[0]` instead of `result[0]`
- Added proper error handling and state management in React component
- Added debug logging to help diagnose display issues

### Technical Details
- Created test script `scripts/test-raindrop-sync.js` for manual testing
- Verified OAuth flow, token storage, and API communication all working correctly
- Database schema properly stores bookmarks with user association

### Next Steps
- Consider adding pagination for large bookmark collections
- Add bookmark search/filter functionality
