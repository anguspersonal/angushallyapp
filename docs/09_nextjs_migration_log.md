# 📜 Next.js Migration Log

This file logs all **completed migration work** for the transition from Create React App to Next.js. Entries are listed in reverse chronological order.

---

## 📚 Documentation Orchestration

This migration effort is coordinated across three documents:

| Document | Purpose | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| `09_migration_plan.md` | High-level goals, strategy, patterns | 📘 The blueprint |
| `09_migration_tracker.md` | Live task board of all migration tasks | ✅ The task board |
| `09_migration_log.md` | Reverse-chronological changelog of completed work | 🧾 The changelog |

### 🧭 Workflow
- **Plan** defines the approach and checklist templates
- **Tracker** tracks real-time progress (what's in progress, completed, or blocked)
- **Log** is updated only after a task is ✅ complete — it serves as the final audit trail

> 🔄 Maintain the tracker as the daily source of truth, and backfill the log after task completion.

## ✅ 2025-07-13 – TypeScript Configuration Fix & Heroku Build Resolution

- **Heroku Build Failure Resolution:**
  - **Issue**: Heroku slug build failing with "Could not find a declaration file for module 'react-google-recaptcha'"
  - **Root Cause**: `tsconfig.json` contained `"types"` whitelist that prevented TypeScript from discovering `@types/*` packages when `--omit=dev` was used
  - **Solution**: Comprehensive TypeScript configuration fix implemented
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Removed `"types"` whitelist**: Eliminated restrictive type discovery limitation
    - **Added `typeRoots` configuration**: Set `"typeRoots": ["./types", "./node_modules/@types"]` for comprehensive type discovery
    - **Created fallback stub**: Added `next-ui/types/react-google-recaptcha.d.ts` as production-safe fallback
    - **Verified prod-style build**: Tested with `npm ci --omit=dev --omit=optional` to mimic Heroku environment
  - **Build Verification**: ✅ Local prod-style build passes with zero errors
  - **Fallback Strategy**: Stub ensures builds stay green even if packages are accidentally bumped or reshuffled
  - **Impact**: Heroku deployment now succeeds, builds are production-ready and resilient

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - **Migration Log**: Added comprehensive entry documenting the fix and rationale
  - **Updates Log**: Added entry to `docs/03_updates.md` following project documentation standards
  - **Best Practices**: Documented fallback stub strategy for future reference
  - **Developer Guidance**: Clear explanation of why `typeRoots` was widened and stub exists

- **Migration Status Update:**
  - **Build Stability**: Heroku deployment now successful with TypeScript configuration fix
  - **Production Readiness**: Build process optimized for production deployment with fallback safety
  - **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation of TypeScript configuration decisions
  - **Future-Proofing**: Fallback stub prevents similar issues from package changes

- **Files Modified**:
  - `next-ui/tsconfig.json` - Removed `"types"` whitelist, added `typeRoots` configuration
  - `next-ui/types/react-google-recaptcha.d.ts` - Created production-safe fallback stub
  - `docs/09_nextjs_migration_log.md` - Added comprehensive fix documentation
  - `docs/03_updates.md` - Added chronological update entry

- **Next Steps:**
  - Monitor Heroku deployment success with new TypeScript configuration
  - Keep fallback stub for production safety and package change resilience
  - Consider similar fallback stubs for other critical type dependencies if needed

## ✅ 2025-07-13 – ESLint Cleanup & Build Optimization

- **Comprehensive ESLint Warning Resolution:**
  - **Scope**: Addressed 8 critical ESLint warnings across multiple files to achieve spotless build
  - **Files Cleaned**:
    - `bookmarks/page.tsx`: Fixed unused `error` variable in catch block
    - `data-value-game/Gameboard.tsx`: Resolved useCallback missing dependencies warning

## ✅ 2025-07-12 – Collab Page Dev Optimization

- **Dynamic Component Loading for Performance:**
  - Replaced direct imports with `dynamic()` imports for heavy components in `/collab` page
  - **Components optimized**: TraitGrid, CustomCarousel, FounderJourney
  - **Benefits**: Reduced initial bundle size, faster first paint, better code splitting
  - **Implementation**: Added `ssr: false` to prevent server-side rendering of client-heavy components
  - **Loading states**: Added placeholder loading components with appropriate sizing

- **Performance Profiling Added:**
  - Added `console.time('RenderCollab')` and `console.timeEnd('RenderCollab')` for render timing
  - **Purpose**: Monitor render performance and identify bottlenecks
  - **Usage**: Check browser console for "RenderCollab: XYZms" timing data
  - **Benefits**: Quantifiable performance metrics for optimization tracking

- **Turbopack Disabled in Development:**
  - Added `experimental: { turbo: false }` to `next.config.mjs`
  - **Problem**: Turbopack causing CPU spikes and build manifest errors in dev mode
  - **Solution**: Fallback to standard webpack for more stable development builds
  - **Impact**: Reduced CPU usage, improved build stability, fewer compilation errors
  - **Trade-off**: Slightly slower initial builds but much more stable development experience

- **Development Environment Improvements:**
  - **Build Stability**: Eliminated Turbopack-related manifest errors
  - **CPU Usage**: Reduced development server CPU spikes
  - **Load Speed**: Faster initial page loads through code splitting
  - **Developer Experience**: More predictable builds and faster hot reloads

## ✅ 2025-07-11 – Critical CSS Fix & Major Route Migrations Complete

- **Critical Static Asset Loading Fix:**
  - **Problem**: Next.js app compiling but all static assets (CSS/JS chunks) returning 404s
  - **Root Cause**: `layout.tsx` importing `./globals.css` that didn't exist in `next-ui/src/app/`
  - **Solution**: Copied `index.css` and `general.css` from CRA to `next-ui/src/` and updated layout imports
  - **Result**: ✅ First successful render of Next.js app at http://localhost:3000 with no 404s

- **Temporary Hydration Fix:**
  - **Problem**: Next.js AuthProvider hydration check failing due to missing `/api/health` endpoint
  - **Solution**: Added temporary `/api/health` route to Express backend returning `{ status: 'backend-ok', time: '...' }`
  - **Placement**: Route added before CRA fallback to prevent HTML hijacking
  - **Result**: ✅ Next.js hydration now completes successfully, unblocking auth flow

## ✅ 2025-07-09 – Route Swapping Logic Implemented

- Added environment-driven route swapping logic to Express server
- `/login` now redirects to `/next/login` if `ENABLE_NEXT_LOGIN` is set to `'true'`
- `/about` is redirected to `/next/about/` (Next.js)
- All other routes continue to fall back to CRA unless explicitly redirected
- Pattern is extensible for future routes (e.g., `/contact`, `/projects`)
- Updated `config/env.js` to expose `enableNextLogin` property
- Supports zero-downtime, environment-controlled migration of individual routes
- Documented in `docs/03_updates.md` and migration plan
