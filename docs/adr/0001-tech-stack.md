# ADR 0001: Tech Stack - React + Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL

Date: 2025-05-25

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed to choose a technology stack that would:
- Support rapid development and iteration
- Provide strong ecosystem support and community resources
- Enable efficient full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript development
- Ensure scalability and maintainability
- Support modern web development practices and tools

## Decision
We have chosen to standardize on:
- **Frontend**: React.js
  - Modern component-based architecture
  - Large ecosystem of libraries and tools
  - Strong community support
  - Excellent developer experience

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
  - JavaScript/TypeScript across full stack
  - Lightweight and fast
  - Extensive middleware ecosystem
  - Easy to scale horizontally

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
  - Robust relational database
  - Strong data integrity
  - Excellent JSON support
  - Advanced features like full-text search

## Consequences
- **Pros**
  - Consistent JavaScript/TypeScript across stack
  - Large community and ecosystem support
  - Proven technologies with extensive documentation
  - Good performance characteristics
  - Strong tooling support
  - Easy to find developers familiar with these technologies

- **Cons**
  - Node.js single-threaded nature requires careful consideration for CPU-intensive tasks
  - PostgreSQL may be overkill for simple data storage needs
  - React's learning curve for new developers
  - Need to manage multiple package dependencies
