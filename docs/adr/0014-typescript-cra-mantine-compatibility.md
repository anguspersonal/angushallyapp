# ADR 0014: TypeScript/CRA/Mantine Compatibility Resolution

**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Type**: Technical Decision  

## Context

During the React UI build process, we encountered a complex three-way version compatibility conflict between Create React App (CRA), Mantine UI library, and TypeScript ESLint tooling. This conflict prevented successful dependency installation and builds.

## Issue Summary

The build process failed due to missing `react-scripts` and dependency resolution conflicts caused by incompatible version constraints between:

1. **Create React App** - Requires TypeScript ‚â§5.1.x for its ESLint stack
2. **Mantine v7.17+** - Requires TypeScript ‚â•5.0 for proper type support
3. **TypeScript ESLint v8.x** - Not compatible with CRA's ESLint v7 stack

## Detailed Conflict Analysis

| Component | Version Constraint | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| CRA | TS ‚â§ 5.1.x | react-scripts + eslint-config-react-app choke on higher versions |
| Mantine v7.17+ | TS ‚â• 5.0 | Needs TS for typings |
| TS ESLint v8.x | üî• Not compatible with CRA's ESLint stack | CRA uses ESLint v7 stack (via react-scripts) |

## Decision

**Accept the version constraint conflict and use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to bypass CRA's strict peer dependency resolution.**

## Current Solution

| Config | Version | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| TypeScript | `5.1.6` | ‚úÖ Mantine-compatible and within CRA limits |
| `--legacy-peer-deps` | install flag | ‚úÖ Bypasses CRA's strict peerDeps |
| ESLint (CRA config) | Keep as-is | ‚úÖ Don't manually bump versions |
| Mantine | `v7.17.x` | ‚úÖ Fully supported |

## Implementation

### Installation Commands
```bash
# Always use legacy peer deps for React UI
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# For fresh installs
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Package.json Configuration
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "5.1.6"
  }
}
```

## Tips for Safe Development

**Always install using:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Avoid manually updating `@typescript-eslint/*` or `eslint` packages while still on CRA.**

**Lock TypeScript at 5.1.6 in your package.json:**
```json
"typescript": "5.1.6"
```

**For Next.js (post-migration):**
- You can move to the latest TS + ESLint stacks.
- This issue won't persist once CRA is gone.

## Consequences

### Positive
- ‚úÖ Maintains Mantine compatibility
- ‚úÖ Keeps CRA build process working
- ‚úÖ Preserves existing development workflow
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing code

### Negative
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for all installations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot upgrade TypeScript beyond 5.1.6 while on CRA
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot use modern ESLint + TS-ESLint 8.x stack
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential for dependency version drift

### Neutral
- üîÑ Temporary solution until CRA migration completes
- üîÑ No impact on Next.js migration timeline

## Future Resolution

**Once CRA is fully removed (Phase 7), you can:**

üîº Upgrade TypeScript past 5.1.6  
üîº Move to modern ESLint + TS-ESLint 8.x stack  
üßº Drop `--legacy-peer-deps`

## Notes

This ADR documents a temporary compatibility workaround that will be resolved once the Next.js migration (ADR 0013) is complete. The `--legacy-peer-deps` approach is a well-established pattern for CRA projects with modern dependency requirements.
