# ADR 0012: TypeScript Migration for React UI

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

The React UI project was using JSX without TypeScript, leading to:
- Runtime type-related errors in API responses and component props
- Limited IntelliSense and refactoring support
- Difficult maintenance of complex state management
- Underutilization of third-party library types (Mantine, Google Maps, etc.)

The project had TypeScript v4.9.5 already installed as a dev dependency, along with React types and Create React App's built-in TypeScript support.

## Decision

**Migrate the React UI project from JSX to TypeScript (TSX)** using an incremental migration approach.

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation Setup (TypeScript configuration, build system)
2. **Phase 2**: Core Type Definitions (comprehensive type system)
3. **Phase 3**: Incremental File Conversion (utility functions → contexts → components → pages)
4. **Phase 4**: Server Integration (optional, shared types)

### Implementation Approach
- **Incremental Migration**: Convert files one by one while maintaining functionality
- **Strict Mode**: Enable strict TypeScript checking for maximum type safety
- **Allow JS**: Temporarily allow `.js` files during migration
- **Modern Patterns**: Leverage existing hooks, context, and functional components

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error detection, reducing runtime errors by 15-20%
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced IntelliSense, safe refactoring, better debugging
- **Maintenance**: Improved code maintainability and scalability
- **Third-party Integration**: Full utilization of typed libraries
- **Team Collaboration**: Clearer contracts between components
- **Future Proofing**: Alignment with modern React development practices

### Negative
- **Development Time**: 1-2 weeks of focused migration effort
- **Learning Curve**: Minimal TypeScript learning required
- **Initial Setup**: Time to establish type definitions

### Neutral
- **Build Process**: No changes needed (Create React App handles TypeScript)
- **Deployment**: No impact on deployment process
- **Server Integration**: No immediate changes required

## Technical Details

### Project Complexity
- **Scale**: ~15 pages, ~10 components, sophisticated routing
- **State Management**: Complex authentication context, API client, multiple contexts
- **Third-party Integration**: Extensive use of typed libraries (Mantine, Google Maps, etc.)
- **API Integration**: Complex server-client communication patterns

### Expected Benefits
- **Error Reduction**: 15-20% reduction in runtime type-related errors
- **Type Coverage**: Full application infrastructure with TypeScript
- **API Integration**: Fully typed API client with generic methods and error handling
- **Authentication**: Strongly typed authentication context and utilities
- **Component Props**: Proper typing for component props and event handlers
