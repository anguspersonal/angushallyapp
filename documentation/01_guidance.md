    - Created `content` schema.
    - Migrated `public.authors` and `public.posts` tables to `content.authors` and `content.posts`.
    - Refactored `content.authors` (PK to UUID linked to `identity.users.id`, timestamps updated, columns renamed).

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow ESLint configuration defined in the project.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- Write clear and meaningful comments for complex logic.
- **JSDoc for Backend Code:** Actively use JSDoc for all backend JavaScript modules, public functions, classes, and complex type definitions. This aids in understanding, type inference (for IDEs), and can be used for future documentation generation.
  - Example: `/** @param {string} userId - The ID of the user. */`
  - Example: `/** @returns {Promise<Array<Object>>} A promise that resolves to an array of user objects. */`
- **React Component Documentation:** Follow established patterns for documenting React components (e.g., PropTypes, comments for props and state).

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Aim for reasonable test coverage for critical paths.
- Run tests locally (`npm test`) before submitting Pull Requests.
- Integration tests should cover interactions between modules/services.
- Consider E2E tests for key user flows.

### Documentation & Planning
- Keep all README files (root, module-specific, /documentation folder) up to date.
- Document new features and significant changes in the relevant READMEs.
- Include code examples where helpful.
- Update API documentation for any backend changes.
- Regularly update this DEVELOPMENT.md with current status and next steps.
- Log new issues and track progress in [Technical Debt Log](./TECH_DEBT.md).

## Environment Setup

### Required Services

- Node.js
- npm/yarn

### API Keys Needed
- Google OAuth
- Strava API
- FSA API

### Database Connection Management (Development vs. Production)
- The application uses `knexfile.js` to manage database connections for different environments.
- **Development:** 
    - Typically uses environment variables prefixed with `DEV_` (e.g., `DEV_DB_HOST`, `DEV_DB_NAME`, `DEV_DB_USER`, `DEV_DB_PASSWORD`) defined in `server/.env`.
    - Connects to a local or WSL-based PostgreSQL instance.
    - Knex commands like `npx knex migrate:latest --env development` explicitly use the `development` configuration block from `knexfile.js`.
- **Production:**
    - Typically uses a single `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (e.g., provided by Heroku or another hosting platform).
    - The `



### Live database migration

Okay, using `git push heroku main` for deployments simplifies some aspects but also means we need to be very careful with how database migrations are handled, especially with breaking changes like the ones we've made.

Heroku has a mechanism for running migrations, often as part of its release phase.

**Revised Strategy for Heroku Deployment:**

**Phase 1: Pre-Deployment - Preparation & Safeguards (Mostly the same, with Heroku specifics)**

1.  **Full Production Database Backup (Critical):**
    *   Use Heroku PGBackups: `heroku pg:backups:capture --app YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME`
    *   Download the backup: `heroku pg:backups:download --app YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME`
    *   **Verify the backup:** Restore it to a local PostgreSQL instance or a different Heroku Postgres addon to confirm its integrity.
        `pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U yourlocaluser -d yourlocaltempdb latest.dump` (adjust for your local setup).
'm 
2.  **Review All Migrations:**
    *   Thoroughly review every migration script.
    *   **Local Testing (as Staging):** Your local environment, when pointed to a *copy* of your production data (restored from the backup), will serve as your primary staging/testing ground. Ensure all migrations run correctly against this data.

3.  **Production Knex Configuration (`server/knexfile.js`):**
    *   The `production` block in your `knexfile.js` should be configured to use `process.env.DATABASE_URL`. Heroku automatically sets this environment variable for your Postgres addon.
    *   Ensure `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` or appropriate SSL settings are in the production connection object in `knexfile.js` if your Heroku Postgres requires SSL (which it usually does). Example:
        ```javascript
        production: {
          client: 'postgresql',
          connection: {
            connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
            ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } // Or { sslmode: 'require' } or true depending on Heroku's SSL
          },
          // ... migrations, seeds
        }
        ```

4.  **Heroku Release Phase for Migrations:**
    *   Heroku uses a `Procfile` to define your application's processes. You can add a `release` process to this `Procfile` to run database migrations automatically whenever you deploy new code.
    *   **`Procfile` (at the root of your project):**
        ```
        web: node server/index.js  # Or whatever your web process command is
        release: NODE_ENV=production npx knex migrate:latest --knexfile server/knexfile.js
        ```
    *   When you `git push heroku main`, Heroku will first build your app, then run the `release` command (migrations), and if successful, then deploy the new `web` dynos.
    *   **Important:** If the `release` command (migrations) fails, the new version of your app will *not* be deployed, which is good as it prevents running new code against an incompletely migrated database.

5.  **Application Code Deployment Strategy (Maintenance Window Still Advised):**
    *   Because we have breaking schema changes, even with Heroku's release phase, a brief maintenance window is wise. The release phase itself can take some time if migrations are lengthy.

**Phase 2: Deployment - The Actual Migration (Heroku Flow)**

1.  **Schedule/Announce Maintenance Window (Recommended):**
    *   Inform users.

2.  **Enable Heroku Maintenance Mode (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   `heroku maintenance:on --app YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME`
    *   This takes your app offline and shows a maintenance page, preventing users from accessing it during the migration and new code deployment.

3.  **Commit and Push Changes:**
    *   Ensure all your migration files are committed.
    *   Ensure your application code (e.g., `server/routes/contentRoute.js`, `server/routes/dbRoute.js`, `server/index.js` with mounted route, frontend changes in `fetchBlogData.js`) is committed.
    *   `git add .`
    *   `git commit -m "Implementing content schema, refactoring posts/authors, updating APIs"`
