# Phase 1 Complete: CRA to Next.js Migration Setup

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Created Next.js App Alongside CRA
- Created `/next-ui` directory with Next.js 15.3.5
- Configured for static export with `basePath: '/next'`
- Successfully built Next.js app

### 2. Updated Express Server
- Modified `server/index.js` to serve Next.js static files at `/next` route
- Kept existing CRA serving intact at root `/`
- Both apps can now be served simultaneously

### 3. Updated Build Scripts
- Added `build-next` script to build Next.js app
- Added `build-with-next` script to build both apps
- Added `dev-next` and `client-next` scripts for development

### 4. Fixed Import Issues
- Resolved TypeScript import path issues in CRA
- Fixed `.jsx` vs `.tsx` import mismatches
- Temporarily handled test file compilation issues

## 📁 Current Project Structure

/workspace
├── next-ui/                 # 🆕 Next.js App
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── app/
│   ├── out/                 # Static export files
│   └── next.config.js       # Configured for /next basePath

├── server/                  # 🔄 Express Server (Modified)
│   └── index.js             # Now serves both apps
└── package.json             # 🔄 Updated with new scripts
```

## 🌐 URL Structure

- **CRA App**: `http://localhost:5000/` (all existing routes)
- **Next.js App**: `http://localhost:5000/next/` (new routes)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Create first migrated page** in Next.js
2. **Set up shared components** between CRA and Next.js
3. **Migrate route by route** using Express redirects
4. **Test both apps** running simultaneously

## 🔧 Available Commands

```bash
# Build both apps
npm run build-with-next

# Development with Next.js
npm run dev-next

# Start server (serves both apps)
npm start
```

## 🎯 Migration Strategy Confirmed

✅ **No CI/CD changes needed** - same deployment  
✅ **No complex routing** - simple Express redirects  
✅ **Incremental migration** - route by route  
✅ **Easy rollback** - remove redirects to fall back to CRA  
✅ **Zero downtime** - both apps work simultaneously  

This approach allows you to migrate gradually while maintaining full functionality of your existing application.
