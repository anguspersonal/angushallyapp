# Next.js Migration Status Report

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- âœ… Created `/next-ui` directory with Next.js 15.3.5
- âœ… Configured Next.js for static export with environment-aware basePath
- âœ… Modified Express server to handle both CRA and Next.js routes
- âœ… Updated root `package.json` with new build scripts

### Phase 2: Dependencies and Theme
- âœ… Installed correct Mantine v7.17.4 versions (matching CRA app)
- âœ… Created shared theme file (`next-ui/src/lib/theme.ts`) with custom colors
- âœ… Set up PostCSS configuration for Mantine
- âœ… Created root layout with MantineProvider

### Phase 3: Component Migration
- âœ… Created Header component adapted for Next.js Link navigation
- âœ… Migrated About page with all content and styling preserved
- âœ… Fixed all ESLint errors and TypeScript compilation issues
- âœ… Successfully built Next.js app for production

### Phase 4: Development Setup
- âœ… Next.js dev server runs on port 3001
- âœ… About page accessible at `http://localhost:3001/about/`
- âœ… Added proxy middleware for development

## ðŸš§ Current Issues

### Proxy Configuration
- Express server proxy to Next.js dev server not working properly
- Getting 500 errors when accessing `/next/about/` through main server
- Direct access to Next.js dev server works fine

### Next Steps
1. Fix proxy configuration in Express server
2. Test the complete flow: CRA at `/` and Next.js at `/next/`
3. Add redirect from old `/about` to `/next/about`
4. Continue migrating additional routes

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Progress

**Routes Migrated: 1/18**
- âœ… `/about` â†’ `/next/about`

**Remaining Routes:**
- `/` (home)
- `/blog`
- `/projects`
- `/contact`
- `/login`
- Various project-specific routes

## ðŸ“‹ Technical Decisions

1. **Direct Next.js Migration**: Chose Next.js over Vite for SEO/SSR capabilities
2. **Incremental Approach**: Route-by-route migration to minimize risk
3. **Dual App Setup**: Both CRA and Next.js running simultaneously
4. **Mantine v7**: Maintained version compatibility with existing CRA app
5. **Environment-Aware Config**: Different basePath for dev vs production

## ðŸ”§ Build Performance

- **Next.js Build Time**: ~17-20 seconds (vs CRA's slower legacy build)
- **No Legacy OpenSSL**: Next.js builds without compatibility flags
- **Clean TypeScript**: All linting and type errors resolved
